    <h1>A Couple of Place Holders</h1> 
    <p>See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.

            We don't want to set these clouds on fire. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. This is your world.
            
            There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Put it in, leave it alone. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.

            </p>
<p>But <strong> what type</strong> of place holders might we encounter?</p>

<ol>
    <li>Text-- y'know, words?</li>
    <li>Image placeholders-- y'know, pictures?</li>
